= select-nrepl

https://github.com/eraserhd/select-nrepl[]

Text-object support for your editor as nREPL middleware. 

== Installing

Add the following to your `profiles.clj` (`cider-nrepl` isn't strictly
necessary, but if you want this, you probably want that, too):

.profiles.clj
[source,clojure]
----
{:user {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.21.0"]]
        :dependencies [[net.eraserhead/select-nrepl "0.1.0"]]
        :repl-options {:nrepl-middleware [select-nrepl.core/wrap-select]}}}
----

This will add the "select" op to nrepl.  See the operation's descriptor for
more information.  You will need some editor scripting to use this operation.

== Kakoune

For intergrating with Kakoune, install https://github.com/eraserhd/rep[rep]
and see https://github.com/eraserhd/dotfiles/blob/develop/kak/config/kak.symlink/kakrc#L292-L38[this example].

== Note on Cursor Positions

In order to support as many editors as possible, columns are __zero-based
caret offsets__, meaning that they are not actually columns but specify the
location of a caret in between columns.  Zero is before the first character
on a line, and one is just after the first character.
